# Lab 1: Installation Assignment {.unnumbered}

This is your first lab assignment and it correspond to the Lab No 1 in this part of the course. The idea is that we check that everything was installed correctly and you can create your first Jupyter notebook. There are several key steps so read carefully and follow the instructions.

This Lab Assignment will include a GitHub Classroom where you will automatically assigned a repository where you need to upload the outcomes of this assignment. This is an individual assignment and each student will have to generate their repository, and then push the requested files. The assignment will be automatically graded and I will review those grades to provide tufter feedback in Moodle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 1: Check Your Installation

### 1.1 Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt

-   **Windows**: Search for "Anaconda Prompt" or "Command Prompt"
-   **Mac**: Open "Terminal"
-   **Linux**: Open your terminal application

### 1.2 Test These Commands

Type all these commands one after another, then **take ONE screenshot** of all the results:

``` bash
# Check that conda is installed
conda --version

# To see your environments (you should see gg3209 in the list)
conda env list

# Activate your environment
conda activate gg3209

# Check Python is working
python --version
```

**Screenshot 1**: Take a **full screen screenshot** showing: - Your desktop/taskbar with **date and time visible** - The terminal window with all command results - Save this as `screenshot_1_installation_check.png`

::: callout-important
Make sure you name this screenshot exactly as is described. There are automatic tests then will use this name.
:::

üí° **Tip**: Make sure your computer's date/time is visible in the screenshot (usually in the taskbar/menu bar)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2: Create Your First Jupyter Notebook

### 2.1 Start Jupyter

In your terminal (with `gg3209` environment activated), type:

``` bash
jupyter lab
```

This should open a web browser with Jupyter. **Take a full screen screenshot** showing the Jupyter homepage with your desktop/taskbar (including date/time) visible.

**Screenshot 2**: Save this as `screenshot_2_jupyter_home.png`

::: callout-important
Make sure you name this screenshot exactly as is described. There are automatic tests then will use this name.
:::

### 2.2 Create a New Notebook

1.  Click "New" ‚Üí "Python 3" to create a new notebook
2.  Save it as `my_first_notebook.ipynb` (File ‚Üí Save As)

::: callout-important
Make sure you name this notebook exactly as is described. There are automatic tests then will use this name.
:::

### 2.3 Add Content to Your Notebook

**Cell 1** - Add the first Cell and change it to "**Markdown**" (dropdown menu), then type:

``` markdown
# My First GG3209 Notebook

**StudentCode:** [Write your Student Code]  
**Date:** [date when you are working on this]  
**Course:** GG3209 - Part 2
```

**Cell 2** - Add a new cell (click + button), keep it as "**Code**", and type:

``` python
import datetime
import platform
import os

print("=" * 50)
print("INSTALLATION VERIFICATION")
print("=" * 50)
print(f"Date and Time: {datetime.datetime.now()}")
print(f"Student working on: {platform.system()} {platform.release()}")
print(f"Computer name: {platform.node()}")
print(f"Python location: {os.path.dirname(os.__file__)}")
print("=" * 50)

print("Hello, Spatial Data Science!")
print("Testing my Python installation...")

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

print(f"‚úÖ Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
print(f"‚úÖ NumPy version: {np.__version__}")
print("‚úÖ Basic libraries are working!")
```

**Cell 3** - Add another **code** cell:

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple plot
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 1, 5, 3]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(x, y, 'bo-', linewidth=2, markersize=8)
plt.title("My First Plot!", fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel("X values")
plt.ylabel("Y values")
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()

print("‚úÖ Plotting is working!")
```

**Cell 4** - Add another **code** cell:

``` python
try:
    import geopandas as gpd
    print(f"‚úÖ GeoPandas version: {gpd.__version__}")
    print("‚úÖ Spatial data tools are ready!")
except ImportError:
    print("‚ùå GeoPandas not found - please check your installation")

try:
    import folium
    print(f"‚úÖ Folium version: {folium.__version__}")
    print("‚úÖ Interactive maps are ready!")
except ImportError:
    print("‚ùå Folium not found - please check your installation")
```

### 2.4 Run Your Notebook

1.  Click on each cell and press **Shift + Enter** to run it
2.  Make sure all cells run without errors
3.  **Take a full screen screenshot** of your completed notebook showing your desktop/taskbar with date and time **Screenshot 3**: Save this as `screenshot_3_notebook_complete.png`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 3: Export as PDF (Important!)

This is a crucial step - It is important you can export your work as PDF.

1.  With the Jupyter Lab open and your `my_first_notebook.ipynb` already complete.
2.  Go to File ‚Üí Save and Export Notebook As ‚Üí Webpdf
3.  If that doesn't work, try File ‚Üí Save and Export Notebook As ‚Üí PDF
4.  Save and Export Notebook As ‚Üí HTML and then using your browser's print function to create a PDF file.

**üö® Important**: You MUST submit a PDF version.

5.  Close Jupyter Lab. In the terminal press `Control-C` twice to stop it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4: Get Your GitHub Repository

### 4.1 Accept the Assignment (Using GitHub Classroom)

1.  Click on the assignment link: [**\[Assignment Link\]**](https://classroom.github.com/a/D0iz-_cr)

2.  This will automatically create a repository for you named `lab-1-installation-student_GH_account`

3.  GitHub will create your personal copy - wait for it to finish setting up

### 4.2 Clone and Work with Your Repository

1.  Click the green "Code" button and copy the repository URL.

    If you have **windows machine** make sure you copy the HTTPS link,

    ![](images/clipboard-1491517835.png)

    but if you have **MacOS machine**, copy the SSH link.

    ![](images/clipboard-2493197005.png)

2.  Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to where you want to save your work (e.g Documents)

3.  Run this command including the link you have just copied: `git clone [paste-your-repository-url]`

4.  It ill take some seconds to clone locally the repository. Navigate into your repository using `cd` and the folder that has been created. (e.g `cd lab-1-installation-mfbenitezp` )

### 4.3 Add Your Files

Copy all the screenshots you have generated, your jupyter notebook (the file with extension `.ipynb`) and the PDF file into your repository folder:

\- `my_first_notebook.ipynb`

\- `my_first_notebook.pdf`

\- All your screenshots

## Step 5: Submit Your Work

### What to Check Before Submitting

Your Local repository should have:

\- \[ \] `my_first_notebook.ipynb` your Jupyter notebook

\- \[ \] `my_first_notebook.pdf` a PDF version of your notebook\
- \[ \] **3 screenshots** showing your work (all full screen with date/time visible)

In the same terminal where you have launched Jupyter or in a new terminal (but make sure you are in the folder of the repository you have cloned).

Run the following commands to submit your work for this part of the Lab No1 and the requirements of this assignment.

``` bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Ready to Grade"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

**Automatic Validation**: Once you push, GitHub will automatically check:

-   All required files are present

-   Notebook runs without errors (it will make sure your Notebook execute correctly and in your machine)

-   PDF export was successful

-   Screenshots show proper installation

You'll see a **green checkmark ‚úÖ** or **red X ‚ùå** next to your commit showing if validation passed!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Help

### If Something Doesn't Work:

1.  **Don't panic!** This is normal when learning new tools
2.  **Take a screenshot** of any error messages
3.  **Ask for help** in the course Teams Channel or make an appointment during my office hours.
4.  **Include the error screenshot** in your repository

### Common Issues:

-   **Conda not found**: Make sure you installed Miniconda correctly
-   **Environment not found**: Double-check the environment name is `gg3209`
-   **PDF export fails**: Try the browser print method, or just submit screenshots
-   **Libraries missing**: Make sure you're in the right environment (`conda activate gg3209`)

## Well Done

You've completed your first part of the lab 1, now move to the next assignment. For now you can:

\- Use conda environments

\- Create and run Jupyter notebooks

\- Export notebooks as PDF

\- Upload files to GitHub
